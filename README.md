# austin-feeds-me

Austin Feeds Me is a community driven application started by the Austin Droids Meetup.

The goal of the application is to provide an application where users can find events that have free food in the Austin Area.

When the application is in a useable state it will be published to the Google Play Store for distribution.

The application uses Firebase for local and remote storage, MVP architecture, and elements of Material Design.

Thank you to all of our contributors and users!
