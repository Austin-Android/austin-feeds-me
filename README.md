# austin-feeds-me

Austin Feeds Me is a community driven application started by the Austin Android Meetup.

The goal of the application is to provide an application where users can find events that have free food in the Austin Area.

When the application is in a usable state it will be published to the Google Play Store for distribution.

The application uses Firebase for local and remote storage, MVP architecture, and elements of Material Design.

Contributors please branch off of the develop branch.

Thank you to all of our contributors and users!
