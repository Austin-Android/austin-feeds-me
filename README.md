# austin-feeds-me

Austin Feeds Me is a community driven application started by the Austin Droids Meetup.

The goal of the application is to allow users who are signed in via twitter to post events where free food is in Austin.

All users of the application can view the posted events.

The application is building on CircleCI and the build results can be found here:

When the application is in a useable state it will be published to the Google Play Store for distribution.

The application uses Firebase for local and remote storage.
